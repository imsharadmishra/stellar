### In your activated virtual environment, install the packages in requirements_dev.txt with the following command:
```pip install -r requirement_dev.txt```

### Then run the following command to create your package files:
```python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel```

### Use Twine to securely publish your package to TestPyPI. Enter the following command 
```twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*```

### You can tell pip to download packages from TestPyPI instead of PyPI by specifying the â€” index-url flag
